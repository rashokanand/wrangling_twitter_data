# Data Wrangling report

This report deals with a walkthrough of the process of gathering, cleaning and putting to order of some twitter data. 'WeRateDogs' is a famous twitter account, that tweets their ratings for dogs. It collects photos of dogs from various sources such as other twitter users and followers, posts the picture along with a humorous statement and a rating. Our data consists of all the tweets of this account that they have posted ever (over 5000 of them).

The Udacity team received the dataset from 'WeRateDogs' and then have provided to us after a little processing. Only keeping those tweets that contain ratings. They already have extracted some details from the text of the tweet such as the dog name, dog rating numerator and denominator and the dog stage. Hence this is named twitter_archive_enhanced. 

In addition to this, Udacity also have given an image predictions dataset. This consists a prediction of the breed of dog from the image posted using an image classification algorithm. The data consists of 3 predictions for each image and the confidence level of each prediction.
